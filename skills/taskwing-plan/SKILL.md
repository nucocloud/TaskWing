# Create Development Plan with Goal

**Usage:** `/taskwing:plan <your goal>` or `/taskwing:plan --batch <your goal>`

**Example:** `/taskwing:plan Add Stripe billing integration`

The Workflow Contract lives in CLAUDE.md (single source of truth). Obey it always.

## Kill Table

| Impulse | Do Instead |
|---------|------------|
| Auto-answer clarifying questions yourself | Present them to the user and WAIT |
| Skip the clarification checkpoint | STOP with refusal text |
| Plan without clarifying first | Always run clarify before generate |
| Assume the user approved | Require explicit "approve", "yes", or equivalent |

## Operating Principles

1. **Goal clarity first.** Never generate a plan from a vague goal. Run clarify until `is_ready_to_plan` is true.
2. **User approves at every gate.** Checkpoints are hard gates, not suggestions. Missing approval = STOP.
3. **Auto-start after finalize.** Once the plan is approved, immediately run `taskwing task next --auto-start` to begin work. Do not wait for the user to say `/taskwing:next`.

Hard gate for this command:
- Do NOT generate, decompose, expand, or finalize a plan until the clarified goal checkpoint is explicitly approved.
- If approval is missing, STOP and respond with:
  "REFUSAL: I can't move past planning yet. Clarification checkpoint is incomplete. Please approve the clarified goal first."

## How `taskwing plan` works

All plan actions go through a single CLI verb:

```bash
taskwing plan tool --params '<JSON params>'
# or
echo '<JSON params>' | taskwing plan tool --params -
```

The output is always JSON (a `PlanToolResult`). Parse the response and extract the
fields you need (`clarify_session_id`, `is_ready_to_plan`, `plan_id`, `phases`, `tasks`, …).

## Mode Selection

The plan tool supports two modes:
- **Interactive (default)**: Staged workflow with checkpoints at phases and tasks
- **Batch (--batch flag)**: Original all-at-once generation

Check if `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--batch`:
- If yes: Use batch mode (Steps 1-4)
- If no: Use interactive mode (Steps 1-8)

---

# BATCH MODE (when --batch is used)

## Step 0: Check for Goal

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or not provided:**
Ask the user: "What do you want to build? Please describe your goal."
Wait for user response, then use that as the goal.

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided:**
Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the goal and proceed to Step 1.

## Step 1: Initial Clarification

```bash
taskwing plan tool --params '{"action":"clarify","goal":"<goal from Step 0>"}'
```

Extract from the JSON result: `clarify_session_id`, `questions`, `goal_summary`,
`enriched_goal`, `is_ready_to_plan`, `context_used`.

## Step 2: Ask Clarifying Questions (Loop)

**CRITICAL: Do NOT answer questions yourself. Present them to the user and WAIT.**

**If `is_ready_to_plan` is false:**
Present each question to the user exactly as returned. Wait for the user to respond.

**If user says "auto" or "skip":**

```bash
taskwing plan tool --params '{"action":"clarify","clarify_session_id":"<id>","auto_answer":true}'
```

**If user provides answers:**
Pipe a JSON params blob to stdin to keep multi-line answers safe:

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | taskwing plan tool --params -
{
  "action": "clarify",
  "clarify_session_id": "<id from previous clarify step>",
  "answers": [
    {"question": "...", "answer": "..."}
  ]
}
EOF
```

Repeat until `is_ready_to_plan` is true.

## Step 3: Clarification Checkpoint Approval (Hard Gate)

Before generating:
- present `enriched_goal` and assumptions
- ask for explicit approval ("approve", "yes", or equivalent)

If approval is not explicit, STOP and use the refusal text above.

## Step 4: Generate Plan

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | taskwing plan tool --params -
{
  "action": "generate",
  "goal": "<original goal>",
  "clarify_session_id": "<id>",
  "enriched_goal": "<enriched_goal>",
  "save": true
}
EOF
```

## Step 5: Present Plan Summary

Display the generated plan:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PLAN CREATED: [plan_id]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Goal:** [goal]

## Generated Tasks

| # | Title | Priority |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | [Task 1 title] | [priority] |
| 2 | [Task 2 title] | [priority] |
...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Plan saved and set as active.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**After presenting the plan summary, immediately start working on the first task.**

```bash
taskwing task next --auto-start
```

Do NOT wait for the user to say `/taskwing:next` - the plan was just approved, start executing.

---

# INTERACTIVE MODE (default when no --batch flag)

## Step 1: Check for Goal (Same as Batch)

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty or not provided:**
Ask the user: "What do you want to build? Please describe your goal."
Wait for user response, then use that as the goal.

## Step 2: Clarify Goal

```bash
taskwing plan tool --params '{"action":"clarify","goal":"<goal from Step 1>","mode":"interactive"}'
```

**CRITICAL: Present all clarifying questions to the user. Do NOT answer them yourself.**
Wait for the user to respond before proceeding.

If the user says "auto" or "skip", run clarify again with `"auto_answer": true`.

Loop until `is_ready_to_plan` is true.
Save the `clarify_session_id` and `enriched_goal` for subsequent steps.

**CHECKPOINT 1**: User approves the enriched goal before proceeding.
If approval is not explicit, STOP and use the refusal text above.

## Step 3: Decompose into Phases

```bash
cat <<'EOF' | taskwing plan tool --params -
{
  "action": "decompose",
  "clarify_session_id": "<id from Step 2>",
  "enriched_goal": "<enriched_goal from Step 2>"
}
EOF
```

This returns 3-5 high-level phases. Present them to the user:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PROPOSED PHASES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Phase 1: [Title]
[Description]
Rationale: [Why this phase is needed]
Expected tasks: [N]

## Phase 2: [Title]
...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**CHECKPOINT 2**: Ask user to:
- Approve phases as-is
- Request regeneration with feedback
- Skip specific phases

## Step 4: Expand Each Phase (Loop)

For each approved phase:

```bash
taskwing plan tool --params '{"action":"expand","plan_id":"<plan_id>","phase_id":"<phase_id>"}'
```

This returns 2-4 detailed tasks for the phase. Present them:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TASKS FOR PHASE: [Phase Title]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

## Task 1: [Title]
Priority: [priority]
Description: [description]
Acceptance Criteria:
- [criterion 1]
- [criterion 2]

## Task 2: [Title]
...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Remaining phases: [N]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**CHECKPOINT 3** (per phase): Ask user to:
- Approve tasks and continue to next phase
- Request regeneration with feedback
- Skip this phase

Repeat for each phase until all are expanded.

## Step 5: Finalize Plan

After all phases are expanded:

```bash
taskwing plan tool --params '{"action":"finalize","plan_id":"<plan_id>"}'
```

## Step 6: Present Final Summary

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PLAN FINALIZED: [plan_id]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Goal:** [goal]

## Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: [Title]
  1. [Task 1 title] (Priority: [P])
  2. [Task 2 title] (Priority: [P])

### Phase 2: [Title]
  3. [Task 3 title] (Priority: [P])
  4. [Task 4 title] (Priority: [P])

...

**Total:** [N] phases, [M] tasks
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Plan saved and set as active.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**After presenting the plan summary, immediately start working on the first task.**

```bash
taskwing task next --auto-start
```

Do NOT wait for the user to say `/taskwing:next` - the plan was just approved, start executing.
